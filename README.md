# Sales-Reporting-and-Prediction-System
Core Project for SWE30010

The brief given to us was as follows:
People Health Pharmacy is a small pharmacy based in Hawthorn. We offer various medicine, health care products and accessories.
Currently we are using a paper based system to record our sales. Our company is finding it difficult to gain a better understanding of our weekly and monthly sales. We also frequently run out of certain items that are in demand.
We are in need of an application that can analyses our sales data and produces a set of reports that would help our manager improve their product ordering decisions.
The application must offer a graphical user interface. However, the reports generated by the automatic analysis need to be in a format that can be easily translated into CSV (comma separated values) files for further processing.

From this brief we were required to deliver a software solution that would meet the requirements outlined in this brief.
